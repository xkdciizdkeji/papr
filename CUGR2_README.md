CUGR 2.0
======================================
CUGR 2.0, the successor of [CUGR](https://github.com/cuhk-eda/cu-gr), is a VLSI global routing tool developed by the research team supervised by Prof. Evangeline F. Y. Young at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
CUGR 2.0 is a detailed routability-driven global router and its solution quality is solely determined by the final detailed routing results.

Please read our paper for more technical details:

* Jinwei Liu, Evangeline F. Y. Young,
EDGE: Efficient DAG-Based Global Routing Engine,
ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC), San Francisco, CA, USA, July 9-13, 2023.

(CUGR 2.0 supports ICCAD'19 benchmarks ([v2](http://iccad-contest.org/2019/Problem_C/iccad19_benchmarks_v2.tar.gz), [hidden](http://iccad-contest.org/2019/Problem_C/iccad19_hidden_benchmarks.tar.gz)).
This version of code is consistent with the DAC paper.)

## 1. How to Build

**Step 1:** Download the source code. For example,
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cuhk-eda/cu-gr-2
```

**Step 2:** Go to the project root and build by
```bash
$ cd cu-gr-2
$ scripts/build.py -o release
```

Note that this will generate two folders under the root, `build` and `run` (`build` contains intermediate files for build/compilation, while `run` contains binaries and auxiliary files).
More details are in [`scripts/build.py`](scripts/build.py).
